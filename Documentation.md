## Introduction:
The FFT essentially converts a signal from its time-based representation to its frequency-based representation, allowing us to dissect the signal into its fundamental frequencies. This process has broad applications across multiple fields, such as signal processing, engineering, and physics. In the case of CO2 or methane data, applying FFT enables the understanding of recurring patterns or prominent frequencies in the dataset. It helps in uncovering cyclic behaviors or notable shifts in gas concentrations over time. By breaking down the data into its frequency components, the FFT reveals the waves needed to reconstruct the original signal. This is particularly valuable for recognizing cyclic trends, identifying significant frequencies, and eliminating unwanted noise from the dataset.
## Data Selection
[Data Station](https://gml.noaa.gov/dv/data/index.php?category=Greenhouse%2BGases&parameter_name=Carbon%2BDioxide&frequency=Monthly%2BAverages&search=sand+island): We have chosen the data of Sand Island, Midway, United States (MID) where air samples are collected in glass flasks.
